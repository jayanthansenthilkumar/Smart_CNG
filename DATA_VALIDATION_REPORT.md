| Service | Required Data | Status |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| **Conversion Calculator** | vehicle_database.json | ✅ Compatible |
| | - lowercase fuel keys | ✅ Fixed |
| | - cng_conversion_kits array | ✅ Added |
| | - {fuel_type}_efficiency fields | ✅ Present |
| **Service Center Locator** | service_centers.json | ✅ Compatible |
| | - 8 centers with locations | ✅ Validated |

---

## 7. File Encoding Standards

### ⚠️ Important: UTF-8 Requirement

All JSON data files are UTF-8 encoded. Python services on Windows must explicitly specify encoding:

```python
# ✅ CORRECT
with open('data/tips_recommendations.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

# ❌ WRONG (will fail on Windows with cp1252 error)
with open('data/tips_recommendations.json', 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
```

### Files Requiring UTF-8:
- ✅ tips_recommendations.json (contains special characters)
- ✅ All JSON files (for consistency and cross-platform compatibility)
