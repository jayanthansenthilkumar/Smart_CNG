- **API Docs**: Check individual service files in `services/`
- **Models**: See `models/cng_calculator.py` for database schema

### ⚠️ Known Issues

1. **Wait Time Warning**: "Target wait time column not found" - This is non-critical, ML model needs CSV update
2. **Service Integration**: Some services need to be connected with JSON datasets (planned)

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting

#### Application Won't Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Initialize database
python init_db_simple.py

# Start application
python app.py
```

#### Login Fails
- Check if database is initialized
- Use exact credentials: demo_user / demo123
- Case-sensitive!

#### No Data Showing
- Run `python init_db_simple.py` to reset and populate database
- Check if Flask server is running
- Clear browser cache

### 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test all features** - Navigate through dashboard and try each feature
2. **Add your own data** - Create new vehicles, log refueling
3. **Explore datasets** - Check the JSON files in `data/` folder
4. **Customize** - Modify templates in `templates/` folder
5. **Enhance** - Add more routes, tips, or service centers to JSON files

### 💡 Tips

- Use **demo_user** account for testing (has more sample data)
